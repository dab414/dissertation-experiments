  experiment 2:
    collected 2 yesterday, but changed the thresholds since then so they're unusable
    put out for 5 today, so far 2 are in
      it's taking forever though
      the 2 that came in look good, so im thinking about just leaving them in the main txtData/ directory and launching 
    also i think im gonna knock the max time per assignment down to 1 hour from 2 hours

    current balance: $14.30
    additional workers needed: 65
    cost of additional workers: $117.00
    amount to add to balance: $117 - $14.30 = $102.7
    I only added $100 cuz i made a math error the first time
    adding an additional $50
    to reach 70 subjects, i need to put out:
      7 full HITs
      1 HIT with 2 assignments

7/24/2019
  had to cut the last one short, only collected 5 or so
  im gonna request an additional 23 today
  23 subjects should cost 41$
  current balance is $64.70

7/23/2019
	Current account balance is $73.70
		first batch of 8 HITs completed, 46 subjects received payment (not including ~2 pilot subjects)
	Going to put out 3 more HITs
		collecting 27 more subjects
		if they're all good, will bring total to 73
		request more as needed
	should need $48.60 to cover this new batch, so we should be good to go

7/22/2019
  $144 should cover 80 subjects
  uploading that amount today
  and im only posting 8 total HITs with 9 max assignments each so = 72 workers

7/21/2019
  already $12.50 left on the account from last November
