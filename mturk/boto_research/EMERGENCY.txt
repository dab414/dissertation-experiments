need to figure out boto3 asap i guess

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46692234/how-to-submit-mechanical-turk-externalquestions-with-boto3

^ the only information about implementing external hit in boto3

the docs:
https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/mturk.html#MTurk.Client.create_hit

the trick is to call the question in the create_hit() method with:
	q.get_as_xml()

	and it works!

	thank the fucking god

	i need to thank that stack overflow dude
