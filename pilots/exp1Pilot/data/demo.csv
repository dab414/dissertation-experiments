No bugs or programming errors experienced here. 
The instructions were clear. The only thing that I wasn't sure about was whether I should be trying to only select cards from one deck or whether I should be trying to use both decks. Eventually I started only using one deck since that was easier, but it felt the deck I chose was just because it was simpler for me to click the letter ""d"" than the letter ""f"" (and not because one deck felt easier).
I timed myself and not including these comments it took me 32:44:63. I did have to pause in the middle of it, though so the computer might tell you that it took me like two hours or something. I started the time again when I got back on my computer. 
Other than that (and I'm sure this is part of the purpose of the experiment) it was just mentally draining. Like I really had to focus to get all those clicks right. ",1196,3Y5140Z9DY0USBMZS1LBDTANZOXPI7,other,corrected,16/07/2019@12:31:50,male,hispanic,1024
