		<p>If you have two major projects to finish, would you rather finish one first before moving on to the next, or complete parts of each project until you finish both? Switching tasks can be a very complicated process and doing so requires you to spend more time with the activity than when doing a single task. The experiment that you have participated in today examines the mechanisms involved in task switching.</p>
		<p>When we have to switch from one task to another, several processes must occur. First we have to forget or inhibit the task that we have just completed. Then we have to prepare for or facilitate the task that we are going to perform next. Both of these processes take some amount of time, so that switching between two tasks from one trial to the next requires more time and effort than repeating the same task across two trials. But what if you were rewarded for switching tasks? </p>
		<p>In the current experiment, we are interested in looking at how people switch tasks in response to rewards for switching tasks. Previous research in the lab has shown that when there is no reward system and people are told to respond randomly, choices are very influenced by factors such as how fast the number appears on each trial. We will be looking to see how adding this reward system affects decisions about which task to perform. We will also be looking at how varying the probabilities and values of those rewards affects behavior. Our goal is to better understand how external factors (stimulus timing) and internal factors (point maximizing strategies) interact with each other to produce decisions.</p>
