  i *think* three choice is working well
  my only concern is, for the neutral trials, there's very little attribute space on the switching dimension
  i've noticed several times the p(switch | neutral) = p(switch | hardTask), which i don't like
  but fr i think we're at a point where things are really working

  alright, can't put this off anymore
  time to really think hard about how im gonna program all these
  exp1 is the most important to get off the ground rn... but i ought to think whether i can consolidate some of the programming efforts across all three exps

  things like certain html pages or css might pretty easily transfer across exps.. i think that's easy enough to copy & paste tho..
  so maybe the idea will be to, while programming exp1, think about how i can abstract certain operations across all experiments, then build up a library that i can source from throughout

  put together a basic opening slide 
  still need to do key remind and stimulus slide [for cued practice, to start]
